Future Rules:
Nested steps that go 2+ layers deep
Number of Feature/Step files
Unused Inline/Example table variable
Unused step definition parameters
Identical backgrounds across features
Verifying more than one end case, more than 1 and after a Then
Multiple Given/When/Then's
Scenarios with the same name as the feature
Scenarios with same name in feature
Comma's in title
Unimplemented steps
Folder Structure (cucumber convention) Features> (step_definitions, support/env.rb)
Puts statements in steps
method definitions found in step definition
Commented tags
Tag followed by comment before scenario (super difficult)
Incomplete Examples Table(Nothing following the Examples: line) Causes fatal lexing errors
Empty file(no content for steps.rb or .feature files)
Empty Feature file(no feature declaration)
Number use in step
One word name scenario
Lines of code in step definition

Future Problems/Issues log:
Tagged Examples Table
Multiple example tables
Custom rule file parsed as command line argument
Displaying parameters use per step definition
should be able to parse Feature title that doesn't (the missing colon) match and throw rule
The worse the feature, the darker the title bar.
Time generated in html
Output the rule set at bottom of html
force text wrap on table columns so that not
