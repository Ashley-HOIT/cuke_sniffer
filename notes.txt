Future Rules:
Nested steps that go 2+ layers deep
Number of Feature/Step files
Unused Inline/Example table variable
Unused step definition parameters
Identical backgrounds across features
Verifying more than one end case, more than 1 and after a Then
Multiple Given/When/Then's
Scenarios with the same name as the feature
Scenarios with same name in feature
Comma's in title
Unimplemented steps
Folder Structure (cucumber convention) Features> (step_definitions, support/env.rb)
Puts statements in steps
method definitions found in step definition
Commented tags
Tag followed by comment before scenario (super difficult)
Incomplete Examples Table(Nothing following the Examples: line) Causes fatal lexing errors
Empty file(no content for steps.rb or .feature files)
Empty Feature file(no feature declaration)
