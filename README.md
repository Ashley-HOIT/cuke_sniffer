##Purpose
A ruby library used to root out smells in your cukes. Tailored for identifying 		 critical problems as well as general improvements to your project/features/scenarios/step definitions.

Scoring is based on the number of 'smells' in a cucumber project, where smells
are potential misuses or errors. Cuke_sniffer follows a 'golf score' type system
where the lower the number, the better. 'Min' refers to the overall best score
for a particular object and the 'Max' is the overall worst object score.
